<p> Hi, I'm Nada.</p>
<p>I'm currently a third year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a minor in Arabic. This fall, I will be taking Discrete Math and Probability Theory (CS 70), Machine Structures (CS 61C), Social Implications of Computing (CS 195), and Survey of Arabic Literature (Arabic 111A).

    In my spare time, I enjoy programming, cooking, doing yoga, and sleeping.

    Thanks for visiting my site!
